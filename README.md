# Walking-Challenge-RPG

The Walking Challenge RPG is a project meant to make people walk to progress through a game. It sounds evil, but we decided to do it to give a more tangible reward for those who want to exercise and play a game at the same time. As of now, this is how you navigate through the project.

The title screen tracks the number of steps you take. It may freeze right now, but it is actually calculating gold gained. You can leave this page by tapping the castle menu button. If the screen is frozen, you can't tap this button. It may take a few tries. You can avoid the freeze by pressing this button immediately.

The next screen is the castle menu. This is where all the buildings that Hero Cat can use would be. Currently, only a white placeholder box is here to press. This opens the inventory. The world map is another labeled button which brings you to said world map. There is a back button in the top left of all these screens. It will bring you back to the title screen.

The inventory displays a large number of items. Only the sword does anything. Tap an item to equip it. Equipping the sword actually has an effect; Hero Cat's attack will go up. It doesn't say what it does, but if you run the code in XCode, "Silver Sword Equipped" will be displayed in the console.

The world map has a small blue box representing the first world, Greenhorn Grasslands. The back button is here too.

The world Greenhorn Grasslands is basically a level select. There is only one level right now, accessed by the black box on the right.

This level is a battle between Hero Cat and a single gray rat. Tap the rat to battle it. Hero Cat's HP is displayed, and the enemy displays how much damage it takes when you tap it. When you win, the rat is defeated and disappears. All you can do now is leave. You can leave anytime you want, actually, by tapping the back button in the top left.

These are all the functions that we currently have.
